# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ Kazakhstan Constitution AI Assistant (On-Chain)

This project is a decentralized AI Assistant that can answer questions about the **Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan** using vectors stored **directly on the blockchain**. It combines OpenAI's embeddings, smart contracts written in Solidity, and a Streamlit interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Start Ganache
Run a local Ethereum blockchain using:
```bash
ganache
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract
- Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
- Paste and compile `VectorStore.sol`
- Deploy to `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (Custom HTTP Provider)
- Copy the deployed contract address

### 3. Update `.env`
```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 4. Run Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## ðŸ“„ Features

- Upload a PDF of the Constitution
- Split into chunks using LangChain
- Generate OpenAI embeddings for each chunk
- Store all vectors **on-chain**
- Query the assistant: your question is embedded, compared to stored vectors, and answered by OpenAI using the best matching chunk(s)

## ðŸ’¬ Example

**Prompt:**  
> Who is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces?

**AI Response:**  
> The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, as stated in Article 44 of the Constitution.
